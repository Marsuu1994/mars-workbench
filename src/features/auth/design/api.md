# Actions & Data Layer

## Principles

- Before adding a new action or endpoint, check if an existing one can be extended to cover the case.
- Keep handlers thin — validate input, call service, return result. No business logic inside handlers.
- One handler per logical operation, not per UI interaction. A single handler can cover multiple related mutations.
- If two flows share the same mutation, they share the same handler. Never duplicate handler logic.
- Use Server Actions for mutations triggered from Server or Client Components. Use API routes when you need webhooks, streaming, or third-party callbacks.
